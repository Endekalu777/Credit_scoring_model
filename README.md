# Credit Scoring Model for Buy-Now-Pay-Later Service
This repository contains the project developed to create a Credit Scoring Model for enabling a buy-now-pay-later service. The model aims to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers using data provided by an eCommerce platform. The project is designed to help a financial institution evaluate customers and offer them the ability to purchase products on credit.

# Project Overview
Credit scoring is a quantitative process that estimates how likely a potential borrower is to default on a loan. Using statistical techniques, this model analyzes borrower information in relation to their past loan performance. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a robust credit scoring system that:

- **Risk Categorization**: Classifying users into high-risk and low-risk categories based on observable features.
- **Risk Probability Estimation**: Calculating the probability of default for new customers.
- **Credit Score Assignment**: Deriving credit scores based on the estimated risk profiles.
- **Loan Optimization**: Predicting the optimal loan amounts and durations for borrowers.
